# VPKParser
A simple c# project parsing triangles &amp; verticies from Valve's CS2 VPK-files.

# A side note
This project is still in development, and it looks like it processes some verticies wrong, and on some maps - meshes are a little mess.\
If you have any solutions for that, please submit a PR. Thanks!
